How to create array in ruby:- Array.new or Array.new(size)
Populating an array with data:- students = Array.new(7,"Subhakanta"), Students = ["Subhakanta", "Subham", "Sooraj", "Prasanjeet"]
Finding out information about array:- students.empty?, students.size, students[0].class
Accessing array element:- students[0],students.at(0), students.first, students.last,students[-1]--> this will give last element
Finding index of an element:- students.index("Subhakanta"), students.rindex("Subhakanta")--> Give last matching element in array
Subset of an array:- students[1,3], students[1..3], students.slice(1..3)


COMBINING RUBY ARRAYS:-
1) days1 = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed"]
days2 = ["Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
days = days1 + days2
=> ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]

2) days = days1.concat(days2)

3)days1 = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed"]
days1 << "Thu" << "Fri" << "Sat" << "Sun"
=> ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]

INTERSECTION, UNION and DIFFERENCE of arrays:-
operating_systems = ["Fedora", "SuSE", "RHEL", "Windows", "MacOS"]

linux_systems = ["RHEL", "SuSE", "PCLinuxOS", "Ubuntu", "Fedora"]

union:- operating_systems | linux_systems
=> ["Fedora", "SuSE", "RHEL", "Windows", "MacOS", "PCLinuxOS", "Ubuntu"]---> also removed duplicate Items

intersection:- operating_systems & linux_systems
=> ["Fedora", "SuSE", "RHEL"]

Difference:- operating_systems - linux_systems
=> ["Windows", "MacOS"]

Identify Unique array elements:-

linux_systems.uniq--- but it will not save the output to source array 
linux_systems.uniq!--- this will save the output to source array

Ruby Can also be treated as an stack and LIFO operation can be performed:-

students.push "sowji"---> last in
students.pop----> Last element inserted will be first out

Ruby Array comparisions:-

The == method returns true if two arrays contain the same number of elements and the same contents for each corresponding element.
The eql? method is similar to the == method with the exception that the values in corresponding elements are of the same value type.

Finally, the <=> method (also known as the "spaceship" method) compares two arrays and returns 0 if the arrays are equal, -1 one if the elements are less than those in the other array, and 1 if they are greater.

Modifying Arrays:-
using insert , it takes index number and value as parameter
Arrays.insert(1,"sowji")---> sowji will be inserted as first index

colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
=> ["red", "green", "blue"]=> ["red", "yellow", "blue"]--> green will be replaced with yellow

multiple elements can be changed by using range:- colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
=> ["red", "green", "blue"]

colors[1..2] = "orange", "pink"
=> ["orange", "pink"]

colors
=> ["red", "orange", "pink"]

Deleting Array elements:-
based on index:- students.delete_at(1)
based on the content:- students.delete("Sooraj")

Sorting :-
students.Sort
students.sort!
